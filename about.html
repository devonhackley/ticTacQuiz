      <h3>Devon Hackley</h3>
      <p>Hello, I am an Air Force Veteran turned coder. I have spent the past year working as a developer and I'm currently a Software Development Engineering Apprentice at Amazon. I have been programming for several years now and after continually facing those challenges and triumphs, the one thing that was most apparent to me was that I was how growing after those experiences. Not just in skills but in other aspects as well. That is something that has resonated with me about Technology, is the fact that it's constantly encouraging and innovating growth. I'm personally excited to continue my growth at Amazon by building applications that not only, reach users and inspire them to grow, but to also continue the growth and impact that technology has in our everyday lives and future.</p>

      <h3>Tisha Greenidge</h3>
      <p>My background experience includes Education, Project Management, Data Analytics and Web Development and Electrical (in the Navy Reserves). I started coding in high school, and wrote my first program in Quick Basic. Since then, I have written programs in C++, Pascal, Javascript, Ruby, Python and Java. I am excited to be surrounded by incredibly smart people at Amazon, and hope to hone my software engineering skills that will allow me to develop software at scale.</p>

      <h3>Peter Tynan</h3>
      <p>My name is Peter. I'm 24 years old, born and raised here in Seattle, WA - Ballard to be exact! At this time 2 years ago, I was student teaching 6th grade math at Shuksan Middle School in Bellingham. I realized that wasn't the path I wanted to take, and so at this time 1 year ago I finished my Bachelor's degree in Math, enlisted in the Washington National Guard and left for training. I learned networking concepts through my IT Specialist role in the army, but software development was much more appealing to me and I jumped at the opportunity to be trained by AWS and CodeFellows. My experiences - both as a teacher and as a student - have helped me develop a strong understanding of myself as a learner, and how I can play to my strengths while working with my weaknesses. I am so excited to learn more software development; I think that automation will continue to be increasingly important in the future, and I want to be there as it develops. I hope I can develop automation that can be used ethically and to the benefit of all people, not only the privileged.</p>
