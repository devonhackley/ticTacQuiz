      <h3>Devon Hackley</h3>
      <p>Hello, I am an Air Force Veteran turned coder.  I have spent the past year working as a developer and I'm currently a Software Development Engineering Apprentice at Amazon. I have been programming for several years now and after continually faceing those challenges and triumphs, the one thing that was most apparent to me was that I was how growing after those experiences. Not just in skills but in other aspects as well. That is something that has resonated with me about Technology, is the fact that it's constantly ecouraging and innovating growth. I'm personally excited to continue my growth at Amazon by building applications that not only, reach users and inspire them to grow, but to also continue the growth and impact that technology has in our everyday lives and future.</p>

      <p>My background experience includes Education, Project Management, Data Analytics and Web Development and Electrical (in the Navy Reserves). I started coding in high school, and wrote my first program in Quick Basic. Since then, I have written programs in C++, Pascal, Javascript, Ruby, Python and Java. I am excited to be surrounded by incredibly smart people at Amazon, and hope to hone my software engineering skills that will allow me to develop software at scale.</p>
