      <p>Users can either play using our Default quiz, or make up their own questions to create their own quiz!</p>
      <ol>
        <h2>How To Play:</h2>
        <li>Starting a new game:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>From the Home screen, click on "Let's Play".</li>
          <li>Enter each player name - make sure they don't match!</li>
          <li>Select the quiz you want to play. You can use our default quiz, or create and try your own!</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Game Flow:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Player 1 goes first. On your turn, click on any square with a "?" marker. A question box will appear - answer the question correctly to take and mark that square!</li>
          <li>Answer wrong, and you will get NOTHING. Either way, it's now your opponent's turn.</li>
          <li>Players alternate turns until either player WINS by getting 3 squares in a row, or until the whole grid is filled and there's no winner.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Tiebreaker Questions:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If the same square is answered incorrectly twice, it will turn red.</li>
          <li>Clicking a red square will bring up a tiebreaker question: answer it right and you get the square, but answer wrong and that square goes to your opponent! Approach with caution.</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
