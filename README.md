#Tic Tac Quiz

Collaborative project by Devon Hackley, Tisha Greenidge, Paolo Chidrome, and Peter Tynan

## Project Overview

We created a Tic Tac Toe quiz game made for 2 players. Players take turns; on their turn a player will select a square, and then must correctly answer a random question to place their mark in that square. Same as the tic tac toe you know and love - the game ends when one player places 3 of their marks in a row and wins.

## User Profiles and Statistics

Unique usernames track the number of wins, losses, and draws that player has. Players can look at the Leaderboard and see a list of the players with the best win/loss records!

## Customization

Our quiz asks questions about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but what if a teacher wants to use it for another subject? We've given users the option to create and save their own quiz, and play Tic Tac Quiz using their custom Question Banks!
